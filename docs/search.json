    "text": "The Role of Data in Quality Improvement\n\n\nThe modern quality improvement practices have initially been influenced by the continuous improvement in the automotive industry. These practices have been adopted in the healthcare system to deliver safe, consistent, and effective care to patients. Qualitative and quantitative data can be used to answer questions, monitor changes, and inform decision-making within a healthcare system (Figure 1). Use of data in quality improvement differ from traditional research with the expectation to assess results in shorter intervals and to incorporate existing evidence correlated with high-quality care into practice rather than posing new evidence.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\nData in Quality Improvement? Measuring and tracking data in quality improvement can improve patient care at a various system levels by:\n\nIdentifying priorities of healthcare and selecting areas for change\nMonitoring existing systems and changes secondary to intervention\nDefining success of intervention and whether implemented intervention was responsible for the change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Measures in Quality Improvement\n\n\nA healthcare system is comprised of multiple factors and sources that affect outcome. Similarly, multiple data measures are required to understand the performance of a complex system and monitor quality improvement. The Donabedian model classifies measures to assess and compare the quality of healthcare systems in forms of outcome, process, structure, and balancing measures.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\nOutcome Measures Evaluate the impact of healthcare provision on the status of patients and populations\nProcess Measures Evaluate quality of the method used to deliver the desired outcome\nStructure Measures Evaluate the capacity of the environment, service, and provision of care\nBalancing Measures Evaluate the unintended consequences of the change that can be positive or negative\n\n\n\n\n\nSources of Data in Quality Improvement\nData used to assess healthcare quality are available from various sources including administrative data, registries, patient medical records, patient surveys and interviews, and direct observation. The selection of the data source depends on the types of measures required to evaluate and monitor quality improvement interventions and the quality of the data from various information systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Type\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative Data\nIndividual user level data collected from claims, encounter, admission, and provider systems\n\nAvailable Electronically\nAvailable for a population of patients across various payers\nComarpable with univorm coding systems and practices\nLess costly compared to patient medical records and registry databases\n\n\nQuality of data dependent on accuracy of documentation, classification, and collection\nLimited clinical information\nTimeliness with lag between data entry and access\n\n\n\nRegistries\nCollection of clinical data to assess clinical performance and quality of care as a part of a larger regional or national data system\n\nProvides epidemiological information that can be used to calculate incidence rates, risks, monitor trends in incidence and outcomes\nCan be used as a benchmark and for comparisons\n\n\nCostly to participate\nQuality of data dependent on accuracy of documentation, classification and collection\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider the types of measures to be extracted from the data source and the quality of the data. The data may vary in accessibility, availability, accuracy, completeness, consistency and usability across various data sources. (Adapted from Vavra 2023 J Vasc Surg Vasc Insights)\n\n\nData Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPareto Chart\nA Pareto chart is a bar chart composed of various factors that contribute to an overall effect arranged in the order from the largest to smallest contribution to the effect.
