    "text": "The Role of Data in Quality Improvement\n\n\nThe modern quality improvement practices have initially been influenced by the continuous improvement in the automotive industry. These practices have been adopted in the healthcare system to deliver safe, consistent, and effective care to patients. Qualitative and quantitative data can be used to answer questions, monitor changes, and inform decision-making within a healthcare system (Figure 1). Use of data in quality improvement differ from traditional research with the expectation to assess results in shorter intervals and to incorporate existing evidence correlated with high-quality care into practice rather than posing new evidence.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\nData in Quality Improvement? Measuring and tracking data in quality improvement can improve patient care at a various system levels by:\n\nIdentifying priorities of healthcare and selecting areas for change\nMonitoring existing systems and changes secondary to intervention\nDefining success of intervention and whether implemented intervention was responsible for the change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Measures in Quality Improvement\n\n\nA healthcare system is comprised of multiple factors and sources that affect outcome. Similarly, multiple data measures are required to understand the performance of a complex system and monitor quality improvement. The Donabedian model classifies measures to assess and compare the quality of healthcare systems in forms of outcome, process, structure, and balancing measures.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\nOutcome Measures Evaluate the impact of healthcare provision on the status of patients and populations\nProcess Measures Evaluate quality of the method used to deliver the desired outcome\nStructure Measures Evaluate the capacity of the environment, service, and provision of care\nBalancing Measures Evaluate the unintended consequences of the change that can be positive or negative\n\n\n\n\n\nSources of Data in Quality Improvement\nData used to assess healthcare quality are available from various sources including administrative data, registries, patient medical records, patient surveys and interviews, and direct observation. The selection of the data source depends on the types of measures required to evaluate and monitor quality improvement interventions and the quality of the data from various information systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Type\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative Data\nIndividual user level data collected from claims, encounter, admission, and provider systems\n\nAvailable Electronically\nAvailable for a population of patients across various payers\nComarpable with univorm coding systems and practices\nLess costly compared to patient medical records and registry databases\n\n\nQuality of data dependent on accuracy of documentation, classification, and collection\nLimited clinical information\nTimeliness with lag between data entry and access\n\n\n\nRegistries\nCollection of clinical data to assess clinical performance and quality of care as a part of a larger regional or national data system\n\nProvides epidemiological information that can be used to calculate incidence rates, risks, monitor trends in incidence and outcomes\nCan be used as a benchmark and for comparisons\n\n\nCostly to participate\nQuality of data dependent on accuracy of documentation, classification and collection\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider the types of measures to be extracted from the data source and the quality of the data.

    "title": "Case Study: Reducing Readmission",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Setting\nThis case study describes the process of a vascular surgery practice to improve operational, financial, and clinical outcomes by reducing length of hospital stay. The practice is affiliated with an urban academic hospital centre with shared operating rooms and hospital beds with other specialties. An audit by the medical centre has demonstrated a disproportionately longer length of hospital stay in patients that underwent open lower-extremity revascularization. This has led to complaints from other specialties and patients due to cancellation and postponement of elective surgeries.\nThe problem was confirmed by a systems survey and patient reports and the approach to quality improvement was developed using the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle as described previously. The samples of data analysis methods presented in this case study are meant to be examples and the quality improvement process will vary depending on the practice. The case study will describe the process of using the case to use the cause and effect diagram, Pareto chart, driver diagram, and run chart to identify problems, support improvements, and monitor progress.\n\n\nProblem\nThe length of hospital stay following open lower-extremity revascularization is longer than expected undermining the quality of patient care and hospital operations.\n\n\nCause and Effect Diagram\nThe practice manager was informed of the prolonged length of hospital stay from the hospital centre’s audit and based on other staff and patients’ complaints. To identify and confirm the problem, the manager completed a review of administrative records and consulted multiple stakeholders including patients and their families, most responsible care service, allied members of the care team (nurses, social workers, care managers), and administration. The stakeholder group were consulted to identify key causes leading to prolonged hospitalization related to materials, methods, people, environment, and equipment.\n\nlibrary(\"SixSigma\")\n\neffect &lt;- \"Longer Length of Stay\"\ncauses.gr &lt;- c(\"Materials\", \"Methods\", \"Equipment\", \"Environment\", \"People\")\ncauses &lt;- vector(mode = \"list\", length = length(causes.gr))\ncauses[1] &lt;- list(c(\"Unavailable Equipment\", \"Delayed Transportation\", \"Incomplete Orders\"))\ncauses[2] &lt;- list(c(\"Lack of Streamlined Clinical Pathway\", \"Delayed Coordination of Discharge\"))\ncauses[3] &lt;- list(c(\"Insufficient Home Supplies\"))\ncauses[4] &lt;- list(c(\"Missed Discharge Information\", \"Missed Discharge Rounds\", \"Team Coordination\"))\ncauses[5] &lt;- list(c(\"Missing Physician Order\", \"Heavy Workload\", \"Limtied Personnel\"))\nss.ceDiag(effect, causes.gr, causes, sub = \"Possible Causes for Increased Length of Stay Following Lower-Extremity Revascularization\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPareto Chart\nFrom the cause and effect diagram, the group identified major factors including lack of a streamlined clinical pathway on the electronic medical records, missing physician orders, lack of routine discharge rounds, exacerbation of comorbidities, delayed transportation, and missing home equipment.\nA chart review and a systems survey were conducted to identify the frequency of the delay type in patients experiencing prolonged hospitalization.

The practice manager and the stakeholder group established targets of early discharge defined as discharge within 5 days postoperatively. The data on proportion of early discharge 6 months prior to the intervention were collected to evaluate the baseline performance. Following consultation with the stakeholder group, the outcome and process measures were selected including length of stay, cost, discharge summary completion within 5 days, and balancing measure including readmission was considered as a potential consequence of early discharge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure Type\nExample\nWhere data could be found\n\n\n\n\nOutcome Measure\n\nLength of Stay\nCost\n\n\nAdministrative data\nHospital Financials\n\n\n\nProcess Measure\n\nDischarge summary completion\nMedication Reconciliation\n\n\nDirect observation\nEMR Chart Review\n\n\n\nStructure Measure\n\nNumber of case managers\n\n\nHR database\n\n\n\nBalancing Measure\n\nReadmission\n\n\nRegistry data\n\n\n\n\nThe data on proportion of early discharges were collected monthly from administrative and clinical records and plotted on the run chart to assess for improvements and monitor progress. The first intervention led to an improved outcome and the implementation and the process of the intervention were reassessed and further improved based on stakeholder feedback. Following additional modifications to the initial intervention, the practice saw a greater improvement in the proportion of early discharge\n\nlibrary(\"qicharts2\")\n\ny &lt;- c(25, 24, 27, 24, 28, 30, 35, 38, 37, 40, 38, 40)\nn &lt;- c(55, 57, 55, 50, 57, 52, 54, 51, 52, 53, 52, 50)\n\ndate &lt;- seq(as.Date(\"2023/01/01\"),\n            as.Date(\"2023/12/31\"),\n            by = \"months\")\n\nnotes &lt;- NA\nnotes[6] &lt;- \"Intervention\"\n\nqic (y, \n     n,\n     x = date,\n     ylab = \"Proportion of Early Discharge\",\n     xlab = \"Month\",\n     notes = notes)"
