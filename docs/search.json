    "text": "The Role of Data in Quality Improvement\n\n\nThe modern quality improvement practices have initially been influenced by the continuous improvement in the automotive industry. These practices have been adopted in the healthcare system to deliver safe, consistent, and effective care to patients. Qualitative and quantitative data can be used to answer questions, monitor changes, and inform decision-making within a healthcare system (Figure 1). Use of data in quality improvement differ from traditional research with the expectation to assess results in shorter intervals and to incorporate existing evidence correlated with high-quality care into practice rather than posing new evidence.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\nData in Quality Improvement? Measuring and tracking data in quality improvement can improve patient care at a various system levels by:\n\nIdentifying priorities of healthcare and selecting areas for change\nMonitoring existing systems and changes secondary to intervention\nDefining success of intervention and whether implemented intervention was responsible for the change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Measures in Quality Improvement\n\n\nA healthcare system is comprised of multiple factors and sources that affect outcome. Similarly, multiple data measures are required to understand the performance of a complex system and monitor quality improvement. The Donabedian model classifies measures to assess and compare the quality of healthcare systems in forms of outcome, process, structure, and balancing measures.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\nOutcome Measures Evaluate the impact of healthcare provision on the status of patients and populations\nProcess Measures Evaluate quality of the method used to deliver the desired outcome\nStructure Measures Evaluate the capacity of the environment, service, and provision of care\nBalancing Measures Evaluate the unintended consequences of the change that can be positive or negative\n\n\n\n\n\nSources of Data in Quality Improvement\nData used to assess healthcare quality are available from various sources including administrative data, registries, patient medical records, patient surveys and interviews, and direct observation. The selection of the data source depends on the types of measures required to evaluate and monitor quality improvement interventions and the quality of the data from various information systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Type\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative Data\nIndividual user level data collected from claims, encounter, admission, and provider systems\n\nAvailable Electronically\nAvailable for a population of patients across various payers\nComarpable with univorm coding systems and practices\nLess costly compared to patient medical records and registry databases\n\n\nQuality of data dependent on accuracy of documentation, classification, and collection\nLimited clinical information\nTimeliness with lag between data entry and access\n\n\n\nRegistries\nCollection of clinical data to assess clinical performance and quality of care as a part of a larger regional or national data system\n\nProvides epidemiological information that can be used to calculate incidence rates, risks, monitor trends in incidence and outcomes\nCan be used as a benchmark and for comparisons\n\n\nCostly to participate\nQuality of data dependent on accuracy of documentation, classification and collection\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider the types of measures to be extracted from the data source and the quality of the data. The data may vary in accessibility, availability, accuracy, completeness, consistency and usability across various data sources.

It identifies and allows concentration of improvement on the “vital few” factors that have the largest contribution to the effect and “useful many” factors that have relatively smaller contribution to the effect.\nThe dataset for a Pareto chart can be create in table format with headings of contributing factors to an overall effect, magnitude of each factor, percentage of the total each factor represents, and cumulative percentage for each factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelay Type\nCount\n%\nCum%\n\n\n\n\nDelay in securing transportation to or placement in planned discharge disposition\n76\n46\n46\n\n\nDelay in coordinating discharge planning with allied healthcare workers, patient, patient’s family\n33\n20\n66\n\n\nDelay in receiving services or equipment for discharge\n24\n14\n80\n\n\nDelay in recognizing discharge needs\n17\n10\n90\n\n\nDelay in diagnostic tests or consultation service\n10\n6\n96\n\n\nCompletion or exacerbation of comorbidities\n5\n4\n100\n\n\nTotal\n165\n100\n\n\n\n\nThe Pareto chart can be created manually or using a software including R with qcc package. The horizontal axis (X) is labeled with the factors contributing to the overall effect in order of largest to smallest. The left vertical axis (Y) is labeled with the unit of comparison from 0 to the total. The right vertical axis is labeled as cumulative percentage from 0% to 100%.\nThe magnitude of the effect is depicted using a bar chart using the unit on the left vertical axis. The cumulative percentage is demonstrated using a line graph from 0% to 100%. The “vital few” factors are identified by the factors that contribute to 80% of the cumulative percentage.\n\noptions(repos = list(CRAN=\"http://cran.rstudio.com/\"))\ninstall.packages(\"qcc\")\n\nInstalling package into 'C:/Users/apj20/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3'\n(as 'lib' is unspecified)\n\n\npackage 'qcc' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\apj20\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpoL3ijb\\downloaded_packages\n\nlibrary(\"qcc\")\n\nPackage 'qcc' version 2.7\n\n\nType 'citation(\"qcc\")' for citing this R package in publications.\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(delay.type=c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'))\ndf$frequency = c(76, 33, 24, 17, 10, 5)\ndf\n\n  delay.type frequency\n1          A        76\n2          B        33\n3          C        24\n4          D        17\n5          E        10\n6          F         5\n\npareto.chart(df$frequency,\n             main='Pareto Chart',\n             xlab='Delay Type',\n             col=heat.colors(length(df$frequency))\n)\n\n\n\n\n   \nPareto chart analysis for df$frequency\n     Frequency  Cum.Freq.
