It identifies and allows concentration of improvement on the “vital few” factors that have the largest contribution to the effect and “useful many” factors that have relatively smaller contribution to the effect.\n\nThe dataset for a Pareto chart can be create in table format with headings of contributing factors to an overall effect, magnitude of each factor, percentage of the total each factor represents, and cumulative percentage for each factor.\n\n| Delay Type                                                                                         | Count   | \\%      | Cum% |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------|\n| Delay in securing transportation to or placement in planned discharge disposition                  | 76      | 46      | 46   |\n| Delay in coordinating discharge planning with allied healthcare workers, patient, patient's family | 33      | 20      | 66   |\n| Delay in receiving services or equipment for discharge                                             | 24      | 14      | 80   |\n| Delay in recognizing discharge needs                                                               | 17      | 10      | 90   |\n| Delay in diagnostic tests or consultation service                                                  | 10      | 6       | 96   |\n| Completion or exacerbation of comorbidities                                                        | 5       | 4       | 100  |\n| **Total**                                                                                          | **165** | **100** |      |\n\n## *III) Instructions*\n\nThe Pareto chart can be created manually or using a software including R with qcc package. The horizontal axis (X) is labeled with the factors contributing to the overall effect in order of largest to smallest. The left vertical axis (Y) is labeled with the unit of comparison from 0 to the total. The right vertical axis is labeled as cumulative percentage from 0% to 100%.\n\nThe magnitude of the effect is depicted using a bar chart using the unit on the left vertical axis. The cumulative percentage is demonstrated using a line graph from 0% to 100%. The “vital few” factors are identified by the factors that contribute to 80% of the cumulative percentage.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(repos = list(CRAN=\"http://cran.rstudio.com/\"))\ninstall.packages(\"qcc\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\t/var/folders/p6/4cwhhzhx2y71kgd20yjk0tqm0000gn/T//RtmpEGyLsj/downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"qcc\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nPackage 'qcc' version 2.7\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nType 'citation(\"qcc\")' for citing this R package in publications.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- data.frame(delay.type=c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'))\ndf$frequency = c(76, 33, 24, 17, 10, 5)\ndf\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  delay.type frequency\n1          A        76\n2          B        33\n3          C        24\n4          D        17\n5          E        10\n6          F         5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npareto.chart(df$frequency,\n             main='Pareto Chart',\n             xlab='Delay Type',\n             col=heat.colors(length(df$frequency))\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs-readmit_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   \nPareto chart analysis for df$frequency\n     Frequency  Cum.Freq.

It provides an overview of the performance of a process and identifies trends and variations in the data as a result of the quality improvement intervention.\n\nThe dataset for a run chart can be created in table format with independent variable including unit of time or quarters at which the values were collected and dependent variable including unit value or percentage.\n\n## *III) Instructions*\n\nThe run chart can be created manually or using a software including R with qicharts package. The horizontal axis (X) is labeled with unit of time or quarters sequentially. The vertical axis (Y) is labeled with the unit value or percentage of the measure of interest. The collected data points can be plotted and connected sequentially. A median line is placed as a horizontal line dividing the data points in half above or below the median value. The graph can be annotated when changes were initiated to observe the effect of interventions on the measure of interest.\n\n## *IV) Example*\n\nA random number generator was used to create a data sample of proportions of patients who met the criteria for early discharge. The data points were plotted by month sequentially. The quality improvement intervention was initiated at run number 6 as annotated. The data points above and below the horizontal median line indicate changes in the process performance at the time of the intervention change was implemented.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"qicharts2\", repos=\"http://cran.rstudio.com/\", dependencies=TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\t/var/folders/p6/4cwhhzhx2y71kgd20yjk0tqm0000gn/T//RtmpEGyLsj/downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"qicharts2\")\n\nset.seed(12)\ny <- rbinom (12, 20, 0.5)\nn <- sample (16:20, 12, replace = TRUE)\n\ndate <- seq(as.Date(\"2023/01/01\"),\n            as.Date(\"2023/12/31\"),\n            by = \"months\")\n\ndate\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"2023-01-01\" \"2023-02-01\" \"2023-03-01\" \"2023-04-01\" \"2023-05-01\"\n [6] \"2023-06-01\" \"2023-07-01\" \"2023-08-01\" \"2023-09-01\" \"2023-10-01\"\n[11] \"2023-11-01\" \"2023-12-01\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnotes <- NA\nnotes[6] <- \"Intervention\"\n\nqic (y, \n     n,\n     x = date,\n     ylab = \"Proportion of Early Discharges\",\n     xlab = \"Month\",\n     notes = notes)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cs-readmit_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# **Driver Diagram**\n\n## *I) Description*\n\nA diagram that displays identified “primary or secondary drivers” or contributors and relationship between them in relation to the overall aim of the project\n\n## *II) Background for measure*\n\nA driver diagram is a figure that displays relationships between the overall aim of the project, the primary drivers that contribute to achieving the aim, the secondary drivers that are subcomponents of the primary drivers, and change ideas to affect the secondary driver.

The project aim provides an objective of quality improvement. The primary drivers have direct impact on the project aim. The secondary drivers are subgroups that impact the primary drivers.
