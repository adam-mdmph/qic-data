It identifies and allows concentration of improvement on the “vital few” factors that have the largest contribution to the effect and “useful many” factors that have relatively smaller contribution to the effect.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"15%\"}\n![](icons/noun-flow-chart-33372.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"75%\"}\n**Driver Diagram**
