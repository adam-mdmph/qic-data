It identifies and allows concentration of improvement on the “vital few” factors that have the largest contribution to the effect and “useful many” factors that have relatively smaller contribution to the effect.\n\nThe dataset for a Pareto chart can be create in table format with headings of contributing factors to an overall effect, magnitude of each factor, percentage of the total each factor represents, and cumulative percentage for each factor.\n\n| Delay Type                                                                                         | Count   | \\%      | Cum% |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------|\n| Delay in securing transportation to or placement in planned discharge disposition                  | 76      | 46      | 46   |\n| Delay in coordinating discharge planning with allied healthcare workers, patient, patient's family | 33      | 20      | 66   |\n| Delay in receiving services or equipment for discharge                                             | 24      | 14      | 80   |\n| Delay in recognizing discharge needs                                                               | 17      | 10      | 90   |\n| Delay in diagnostic tests or consultation service                                                  | 10      | 6       | 96   |\n| Completion or exacerbation of comorbidities                                                        | 5       | 4       | 100  |\n| **Total**                                                                                          | **165** | **100** |      |\n\n## *III) Instructions*\n\nThe Pareto chart can be created manually or using a software including R with qcc package.

The left vertical axis (Y) is labeled with the unit of comparison from 0 to the total. The right vertical axis is labeled as cumulative percentage from 0% to 100%.\n\nThe magnitude of the effect is depicted using a bar chart using the unit on the left vertical axis. The cumulative percentage is demonstrated using a line graph from 0% to 100%. The “vital few” factors are identified by the factors that contribute to 80% of the cumulative percentage.\n\n```{r, warning=FALSE}\noptions(repos = list(CRAN=\"http://cran.rstudio.com/\"))\ninstall.packages(\"qcc\")\nlibrary(\"qcc\")\ndf <- data.frame(delay.type=c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'))\ndf$frequency = c(76, 33, 24, 17, 10, 5)\ndf\n\npareto.chart(df$frequency,\n             main='Pareto Chart',\n             xlab='Delay Type',\n             col=heat.colors(length(df$frequency))\n)\n\n```\n\n# **Run Chart**\n\n## *I) Description*\n\nA graph that depicts the current performance of a process and monitors whether interventions lead to improvement\n\n## *II) Background for measure*\n\nA run chart is a graph that depicts data values over time with a horizontal median line dividing the data in half above and below the median value.
